A script for playing invoker in DOTA2

To all of you you who are viewing this . With great powers of Invoker comes great interest in playing this hero

So I created this script to help you and myself to play the awesome hero



## Usage - 

  ### LINUX - 

      - Install python3 (look at tutorials online)

      - then download script ( dotascript.py )

      - store it in a folder ( preferably desktop , so you can find script easily after launching game )

      - then launch dota2 game

      - Quickly goto folder where the script is stored -> Open terminal -> run $ Python3  dotascript.py

  ### WINDOWS - 

      - Install python3 for WINDOWS (look at tutorials online)

      - then download script ( dotascript.py )

      - store it in a folder ( preferably desktop , so you can find script easily after launching game )

      - then launch dota2 game

      - Quickly goto folder where the script is stored -> Open command_prompt -> run $ Python3  dotascript.py 

      

## Control Basic - QWERTY

  ### Q - Quas

  ### W - Wex

  ### E - Exort

  ### R - Invoke

  ### t - Spell 1

  ### Y - Spell 2

                    

  

  ### After running the script when you press 1 - cold press will be activated as spell 1 , then next press 3 to activate Ice-Wall as spell two

    - Press T and Y to invoke those spell

  ### So to run cold-snap and Icewall combo all you have to do is - Press -> 1 -> 3 -> T -> Y compared to q -> q -> q -> r -> t -> q -> q -> e -> r -> y

    #### that is huge improvement , you can put a combo in 4 keys compared to 10 with basic dota controls
